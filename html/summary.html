			<h2>Summary:  Are Gun Laws a Symptom or a Motivator?</h2>
		</div>

		<div class="homeContent">
			<p>
				The chloropleth maps displayed in the GUNS and HATE pages provide a view of what the Gun Laws for the various states are in relation to the gun deaths, 
				suicides, mass killings, hate groups, and hate crimes that are committed in each state.  Unfortunately many data realtionships cannot be fully 
				realized using only the maps.  This section provides different graphs to further explore the relationships of these issues.
			</p>
			<br>
			<h4>Gun Deaths/Suicides vs Gun Control Laws 2017</h4>
			<p>
				Since 2017 is the latest year that the Gifford Law Center released a score card evaluating the strength of the gun control laws for each state, 
				gun deaths and suicides data for each state for that year was aggregated based on state gun law grade. The gun death / suicide rate was calculated 
				from the total number of deaths and normalized based on total population of those states for each grade.  The following is a bar graph showing this 
				relationship.
			</p>

									 height="500">
					</a>    
					<figcaption><i>Fig. 1</i> 2017 Death / Suicide Rates vs State Gun Law Rating</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				The number of gun deaths per 100,000 persons do show a decline as the Gun Law Grade improves.  States with A- and A grades have the least 
				number of both gun deaths and suicides compared to all other grades.  The decline is less obvious for suicide rates.  The number remains 
				consistently above 14 suicides per 100,000 until the grading of B+.  This does show Gun Laws are effective in minimizing gun deaths and 
				suicides if the are strong enough.  Mid level gun laws may not be effective especially since people can cross state borders to procure arms 
				in states with weak gun laws.
			</p>
			<br>
			<h4>Mass Shootings 2000 to 2018</h4>
			<p>
				Mass shootings have been in the forefront of American news in recent years.  The tragedy that sweeps America like clock-work has led to rage 
				against the ease and accessibility to purchase not only hand guns, but assault rifles which are capable of killing many more individuals in 
				seconds.  To understand this trend, the number of mass shootings were plotted against the year when they occurred. In the same plot, the overall 
				number of victims, both dead and injured, in those mass shootings are also shown in the following graph.
			</p>
			<figure>
					<a href="../images/Mass_Shootings_2000-2018.png" target="_blank">
							<img src="../images/Mass_Shootings_2000-2018.png"
										alt = "Mass Shootings in the United States 2000 to 2018"
										height="500">
					</a>    
					<figcaption><i>Fig. 2</i> Mass Shootings in the United States 2000 to 2018</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				The graph clearly shows that around 2006 the number of mass shootings and the corresponding number of victims begin to rise.  A huge jump in 
				victims is seen in 2017, with more than a ten-fold increase in the number of mass shootings in 2018.  Could this be a reation to the feeling 
				powerless in a heavily conflicted society?  Or perhaps a feeling of empowerment to rectify perceived wrongs?  What events were going on to 
				enrage these unstable individuals?
			</p>
			<h4>Mass Shootings vs State Gun Law Rating</h4>
			<p>
				Does State Gun Laws effect the frequency and severity of mass shootings?  The number of mass shooting victims (both dead and injured) were 
				aggregated based on State Gun Law ratings and normalized based on overall population for each grade.  The following bar graph shows the relationship 
				between normalized number of shooting victims (per million persons), normalized number of mass shooting incidences, and the State Gun Law Grade 
				where the mass shootings occurred.
			</p>
			<figure>
					<a href="../images/Mass_Shootings_vs_Gun_Laws_2018.png" target="_blank">
							<img src="../images/Mass_Shootings_vs_Gun_Laws_2018.png"
										alt = "2018 Mass Shooting Victims per State Gun Law Rating"
										height="500">
					</a>    
					<figcaption><i>Fig. 3</i> 2018 Mass Shooting Victims per State Gun Law Rating</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				The graph does not clearly show that when it comes to mass shooting incidences, strong gun laws necessarily minimize the number of victims or
				incidences.  The overall numbers shown for State Gun Law grade of A are actually higher than those with a grade of D.  Further exploration on 
				specific incidences in key locations may provide a better understanding why gun laws alone are not an effective safeguard.
			</p>
			<h4>Hate Groups and Hate Crimes 2000 to 2018</h4>
			<p>
				Hate Groups have also come to the forefront of American news in recent years.  The political climate has empowered the fringes of society to 
				forth into the public eye when they were previously forced into the shadows.  Data from the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks Hate Groups 
				across the US, and the FBI, which tracks Hate Crimes, were collected and aggregated based on the year they were reported.  The following line 
				graph displays the growth of Hate Groups and Hate Crime since the year 2000.
			</p>
			<figure>
					<a href="../images/Hate_2000-2018.png" target="_blank">
							<img src="../images/Hate_2000-2018.png"
										alt = "Hate Groups and Hate Crimes in the United States 2000 to 2018"
										height="500">
					</a>    
					<figcaption><i>Fig. 4</i> Hate Groups and Hate Crimes in the United States 2000 to 2018</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				The graph clearly shows that number of hate groups has consistently grown since the year 2000 but began to fall after 2011.  The number begins to 
				rise again around 2015.  Interestingly the number of hate crime incidences decrease from 2001 to 2014 before rising again.  Do the number of hate 
				groups a symptom of the political climate and cycle?  And why is the opposite trend seen for hate crimes?
			</p>
			<h4>Hate vs State Gun Law Rating</h4>
			<p>
				Is there a relationship between where hate groups are located and the State Gun Laws that govern them?  Do these State Gun Laws effect the frequency 
				of hate crime?  The number of hate groups observed in 2017 and 2018, and the number of Hate Crime incidences were aggregated based on the State Gun 
				Laws of their location, and normalized based on the overall population of the states with State Gun Law ratings.  The following line graph 
				displays the relationship between Gun Laws, hate groups and hate crime incidences.
			</p>
			<figure>
					<a href="../images/Hate_vs_Gun_Law_Grade_2017-2018.png" target="_blank">
							<img src="../images/Hate_vs_Gun_Law_Grade_2017-2018.png"
										alt = "Hate Groups/Crimes vs State Gun Law Grade"
										height="500">
					</a>    
					<figcaption><i>Fig. 5</i> Hate Groups/Crimes vs State Gun Law Grade</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				For number of hate groups in both 2017 & 2018, there does seem to be a slight decline as the strength of the State Gun laws increses.  The only 
				exception occurs for Hate Groups in 2017 which shows a huge spike in total numbers for states with a Gun Law grade of B.  For Hate Crime incidences 
				occuring in 2017, there is also a general decline as State Gun laws become stronger.  Unfortunately the huge drop in Hate Crime Incidences seen 
				for states with Gun law grades of D+ and B+ sheds doubt that they are strongly related.				 
			</p>
			<h4>Final Thoughts...</h4>
			<p>
				When I first proposed this project, I had the pre-conceived notion that State Gun Laws were not only effective in minimizing gun deaths, suicides, 
				and mass shoootings, but also believed that hate groups and hate crime flourished where State Gun Laws were weak.  Though I did find support that 
				very strong gun laws were effective in minimizing gun deaths, their effect on hate groups and hate crimes were not so clear cut.  The inherent 
				weakness of my original suppositions is that these issue come from very emotional and irrational behaviour and cannot necessarily be predicted and 
				completely safeguarded against.  As well, since these activities are very infrequent, their plotted behaviour can be easily affected by 
				disproportionately extreme events.
