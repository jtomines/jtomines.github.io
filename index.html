<!--# Student Bio Page

## Instructions

* On your own, create a simple bio page for yourself using the following HTML elements...

  * A header that will store your name inside of it
  * An image that will act as a stand-in for your picture with an `alt` attribute which gives a very basic description of the image
  * Two paragraphs that will have text describing who you are
  * An unordered list of links that connect to your social media pages
  * A table that will contain three columns and some data on your favorite movies, songs, books, or activities

## Hints

* Dummy images can be found at [lorempixel.com](http://lorempixel.com/) and dummy text can be found at [lipsum.com](http://www.lipsum.com/). Focus on getting the entire page working before diving into more specific text and images.

## Bonus

* Look into how one might go about linking one custom-made HTML page to another. Once you have found out how, try creating a link from your bio page you have just created to one of the pages you created last class.-->>

    Flotsam in the river of life.... Whipped Husband, Dragon-Father, 2-Sport Coach, Ex-Enterprise Consultant, Data Oldie & Newbie Anal-Lyst
    <br>
    Bred in Cooksville (Mississauga), I remember a great childhood of running through forests, fields, and orchards, and swimming in the creeks.  From public school to catholic school, from oblivious to bright.  Placed extremely well in Waterloo Mathematics Competitions, got into McMaster University Special Arts & Science Programme, only to discover alcohol!  ... Reset... Double major in Biology & Chemistry in UofT.... CRASH... NEW DAD!  Stop School, and started work with City of Toronto.  They discovered I had computer skills.
