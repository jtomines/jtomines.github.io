			<h2>Project Source Files</h2>
		</div>
		<p>The learning objectives of this project was to execute data analysis activities in a group setting effectively by 
			practicing collaborative techniques including the use of a repository to store and share project assets as they were 
			being developed by individual members.  The team implemented the GitHub repository "projWANGRY", where they stored 
			reference materials, python scripts, extracted and generated data files, generated graph images, and the 
			final presentation.
		</p>
		<p>The following is the directory structure of the repository:</p>
		<ul class="repolist">
			<li><strong>0_Reference</strong> - Reference materials including articles and images from the internet</li>
			<li><strong>1_Input</strong> - Data files manually downloaded or extracted via API from identified public data sources</li>
			<li><strong>2_LoadCode</strong> - Development area for Python scripts that would load code from web APIs or raw data files</li>
			<li><strong>3_ManipulationCode </strong>- Development area for Python scripts that would clean up the data and merge data sets</li>
			<li><strong>4_OutputCode</strong> - Development area for Python scripts that would graph merged data sets and output as images</li>
			<li><strong>5_FinalCode</strong> - All properly working Python scripts to be evaluated by the teaching assistants </li>
			<li><strong>6_Output</strong> - All graph images and output created by the Python scripts</li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>Note:  </strong>The parent folder holds all presentation documentation including the proposal and PowerPoint files.</p>
		<p>This repository was originally intended to provide organization during project execution for the purpose to be intiutive for 
			new eyes to reproduce the analysis.  Unfortunately in practice with tight schedules, and unfamiliarity with processes for 
			operating in a shared environment, it was difficult to adhere to the intentions of this structure.  Perhaps later I will go 
			through and properly clean up the repository to a state I had originally envisioned.

				<h2>GitHub Repository</h2>

			<p>The original projWANGRY repository used by the team during project execution was copied to my DataAnalytics repository 
				so that all my work for the UofT SCS Data Analytics Boot Camp would be under the same repository.
