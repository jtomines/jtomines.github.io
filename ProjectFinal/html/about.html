			<h4>Project Information</h4>
			<p><strong>Course:</strong>  University of Toronto SCS Data Analytics Boot Camp<br>
			<strong>Assignment:</strong>  Final Project<br>
			<strong>Author:</strong>  Jose Tomines<br>
			<strong>Date:</strong>  2019 April 18</p>

			<p>This final project was meant to demonstrate the student's knowledge and abilities acquired throughout this 
			course to create something meaningful.  Many possible projects were mulled over, but this one held meaning in 
			terms of content, and was still deliverable within a reasonable timeframe.</p>
			<h4>Project Methodology</h4>
			<p>The following were the tasks performed during this project as set out in the class proposal:</p>
			<ul>
					<li>Determine data sources</li>
					<li>Determine disualization of data</li>
					<li>Determine framework of website</li>
					<li>Build data extraction and cleanup scripts</li>
					<li>Build database</li>
					<li>Build visualization code</li>
					<li>Analyze and comment on visualization</li>
					<li>Assemble website</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Data Sources:</h4>

			<h4>Project Execution Notes</h4>
			<p>The following are comments, notes, and issues encountered during project executions:</p>
			<ul>
					<li>Most data sources provided a means to download data as either an excel or csv file.  Where this option was not available, 
						the data was copied directly from the page and pasted into an excel spreadsheet.</li>
					<li>All mass shooting data from different sources were brought together in the same spreadsheet, and manually inspected to remove duplicate 
						incidences.</li>
					<li>All data sources in excel format were then manipulated using Excel and VBA functionality and then saved as csv files to be used by the 
						Python scripts.</li>
					<li>Python scripts using pandas and numpy imported the data from the csv viles, to further clean up and combine the data into dataframe tables 
						to be used by the visualization scripts.</li>
					<li>The original plan was to build a SQL database and serve the data with Flask to the front end website.  Unfortunately time constraints led 
						to the decision to keep the data as csv files and have the javascript files pull the data in from the csv files. Eventually this website 
						will use an SQL database and Flask engine.</li>
					<li>The website is html/css using Bootstrap 4.2.1, with javascript using jquery 3.3.1.  The visualization used D3 and heavily modeled after 
						Mike Bostock's chloropleth code</li>
					<li>Python with pandas, numpy, and matplotlib, was used to create the static graphs as png files.</li>
					<li>Chloropleth map projects were not dynamically sized and positioned, leading to placement issues for larger browser windows.  This will be 
						fixed in the future.</li>
					<li>Dot projections on chloropleth mapping relies heavily on longitude and latitude.  For state aggregated data, the longitude and latitude of 
						the geographic center of the state (centroid methodology) was used, as described in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_geographic_centers_of_the_United_States" 
						target="_blank" >Wikipedia - List of geographic centers of the United States (Updated list of geographic centers)</a>.</li>
					<li>Normalization of state aggregated data (per 100K persons or per 1M persons) used population estimates for 2018 in <a href="https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-national-total.html" 
						target="_blank" >United States Census Bureau - National Population Totals and Components of Change: 2010-2018</a>. </li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Project Documentation</h4>
			<p>The following documentation was created for this project:</p>
